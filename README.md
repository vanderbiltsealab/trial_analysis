# Capstone

My primary goal with this project is to determine "loops" between parents and children. It is well-known that there is a "circle of security" that children have which is when they are near to a parent. Here, we consider that circle to be when a child is within touching distance of a parent (roughly 1 meter). Here, I find these loops within the data and attempt to analyze who "departs" or walks out of touching distance, and who "arrives" or comes back within touching distance.

## [1. Data](https://github.com/amandashort/capstone/tree/main/data)

First, the data must be read in. In the data folder, there are 3 log files, one for each family member. There are also 3 motion csv's that are generated by running the [motion processing file](https://github.com/amandashort/capstone/blob/main/tottag-motion.ipynb). These files are merged for each individual to obtain a complete record of data for one day.
