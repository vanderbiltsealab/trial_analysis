# Capstone

My primary goal with this project is to determine "loops" between parents and children. It is well-known that there is a "circle of security" that children have which is when they are near to a parent. Here, we consider that circle to be when a child is within touching distance of a parent (roughly 1 meter). I find these loops within the data and attempt to analyze who "departs" or walks out of touching distance, and who "arrives" or comes back within touching distance. The ultimate goal is to see how these trends change as a child gets older and who is driving most of the interaction in either direction.

## [1. Data](https://github.com/amandashort/capstone/tree/main/data)

First, the data must be read in. In the data folder, there are 3 log files, one for each family member. There are also 3 motion csv's that are generated by running the [motion processing file](https://github.com/amandashort/capstone/blob/main/tottag-motion.ipynb). In the [data processing file](https://github.com/amandashort/capstone/blob/main/10_data.Rmd), these files are merged for each individual to obtain a complete record of data for one day. I also create one large dataframe with all individuals' data together. Finally, I create one file for each pair (father with child and mother with child). These files will be used later on for the loop creation.
