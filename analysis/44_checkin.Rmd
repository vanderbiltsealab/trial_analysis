A "check-in" is when one or more parents are in touching distance - this will have the opposite label of the "yn" variable

```{r}
mn$checkin <- ifelse((mn$distance_06 < 1 | mn$distance_07 <1),1,0)

```

```{r}
table(mn$checkin)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mn, aes(checkin, y = ..prop..)) +
  geom_bar(width = .5) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
```

When either parent was within touching distance of the child, how often was each person in motion?

```{r}
mn %>% filter(checkin ==1) %>% filter(motion_03 ==1) %>% summarise(n()/nrow(mn %>% filter(checkin ==1)))
mn %>% filter(checkin ==1) %>% filter(motion_06 ==1) %>% summarise(n()/nrow(mn %>% filter(checkin ==1)))
mn %>% filter(checkin ==1) %>% filter(motion_07 ==1) %>% summarise(n()/nrow(mn %>% filter(checkin ==1)))
```

Child = 10%
Father = 20.8%
Mother = 21.9%
